# Training Your Own Model

In this lesson, we will delve into the process of training your own machine learning model. While using pretrained models can save time and resources, there are situations where training your own model is necessary to achieve the desired results.

We will cover the following topics:

1. **Understanding the Need for Training Your Own Model:** Learn about the scenarios where using pretrained models might not be sufficient and training your own model becomes necessary.
2. **Steps to Train a Machine Learning Model:** Understand the basic steps involved in training a machine learning model, including data collection, data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.
3. **Challenges in Training Your Own Model:** Discover some of the common challenges you might face when training your own model, such as overfitting, underfitting, and the need for large amounts of data.
4. **Tips for Successful Model Training:** Get practical tips on how to successfully train your own machine learning model.
5. **Hands-On Exercise:** Apply what you've learned by training a simple machine learning model using an open-source tool.
