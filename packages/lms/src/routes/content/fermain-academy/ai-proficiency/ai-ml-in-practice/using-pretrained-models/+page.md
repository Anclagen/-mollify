# Using Pretrained Models

In this module, we will explore the concept of pretrained models in machine learning. Pretrained models are a type of machine learning model that has been trained on a large dataset and can be used as a starting point for other machine learning tasks. They can be a powerful tool for solving complex problems, especially when you don't have a large amount of data to train a model from scratch.

## Lessons:

1. **Introduction to Pretrained Models:** Understand what pretrained models are and why they are useful in machine learning.
2. **Using Pretrained Models:** Learn how to use pretrained models in your own machine learning projects.
3. **Training Your Own Model:** While pretrained models can be a great starting point, sometimes you need to train your own model. Learn how to do this effectively.
4. **Hardware Requirements for ML:** Understand the hardware requirements for training machine learning models, and how to choose the right hardware for your needs.
5. **Open Source vs Closed Source Tools:** Explore the pros and cons of open source and closed source tools in the context of machine learning.
