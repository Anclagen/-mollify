# Using Pretrained Models

In this lesson, we will explore the concept of pretrained models in machine learning. Pretrained models are a type of machine learning model that has been trained on a large benchmark dataset to solve a problem similar to the one that we want to solve. 

We will cover the following topics:

1. **What are Pretrained Models?** Understand what pretrained models are and how they can be beneficial in machine learning projects.
2. **Commonly Used Pretrained Models:** Learn about some of the commonly used pretrained models in the field of machine learning and their applications.
3. **How to Use Pretrained Models:** Get a practical understanding of how to use pretrained models in your own machine learning projects.
4. **Fine-Tuning Pretrained Models:** Learn how to fine-tune pretrained models to better fit your specific problem.
5. **Hands-On Exercise:** Apply what you've learned by using a pretrained model in a simple machine learning project.
