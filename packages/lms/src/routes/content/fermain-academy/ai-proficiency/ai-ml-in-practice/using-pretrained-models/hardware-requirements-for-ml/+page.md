# Hardware Requirements for Machine Learning

In this lesson, we will discuss the hardware requirements for machine learning. Machine learning, especially deep learning, can be computationally intensive and may require specific hardware to train models efficiently.

We will cover the following topics:

1. **CPU vs GPU:** Understand the difference between CPUs and GPUs and why GPUs are often preferred for machine learning tasks.
2. **RAM Requirements:** Learn about the importance of RAM in machine learning and how much you might need for different tasks.
3. **Storage Considerations:** Discover why fast, ample storage is crucial for machine learning, especially when working with large datasets.
4. **Cloud vs On-Premises:** Explore the pros and cons of using cloud-based services versus setting up your own on-premises machine learning infrastructure.
5. **Choosing the Right Hardware:** Get tips on choosing the right hardware for your specific machine learning needs and budget.
