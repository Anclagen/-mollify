# Introduction to Pretrained Models

In this lesson, we will introduce the concept of pretrained models in machine learning. Pretrained models are a powerful tool in the AI practitioner's toolkit, allowing us to leverage existing knowledge and save time and computational resources.

We will cover the following topics:

1. **What are Pretrained Models?** Understand what pretrained models are and why they are useful.
2. **Types of Pretrained Models:** Learn about different types of pretrained models, such as image classifiers, language models, and more.
3. **Transfer Learning:** Discover the concept of transfer learning, where the knowledge from one machine learning task is applied to another.
4. **Fine-Tuning:** Learn how to adjust a pretrained model to your specific task, a process known as fine-tuning.
5. **Using Pretrained Models in Practice:** Get practical tips on how to effectively use pretrained models in your own machine learning projects.
