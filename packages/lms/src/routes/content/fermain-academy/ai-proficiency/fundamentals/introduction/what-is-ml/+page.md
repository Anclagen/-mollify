# What is Machine Learning?

Welcome to the "What is ML?" lesson of the Introduction module. In this lesson, we will delve into the concept of machine learning (ML).

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

In this lesson, you will learn about:

1. **Definition of ML**: Understand what ML is and how it's defined.

2. **History of ML**: Learn about the evolution of ML over the years.

3. **Types of ML**: Explore the different types of ML, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

4. **Applications of ML**: Discover the various applications of ML in different industries and fields.

5. **Future of ML**: Discuss the potential future developments in ML and its impact on society.

By the end of this lesson, you will have a clear understanding of what ML is, its history, types, applications, and potential future. This knowledge will be crucial as we delve deeper into the field of AI and ML in the subsequent lessons and modules.

Let's get started on this exciting journey into the world of Machine Learning. Welcome to the "What is ML?" lesson at Fermain Academy.
